	\section{Describe three requirements of time synchronization schemes for WSNs}
	\startsection
		The scheme must be robust such that a node failure does not have a huge impact on other nodes or the whole network. \\
		The scheme must support a sensible scalability factor, such that it can be deployed on a large number of nodes. \\
		The scheme should be precise enough in order to be able to arrange the different events based on microsecond accuracy.

		\subsection{What is clock B's drift from clock A}
		\startsubsection
			The drift of clock B from clock A is $5s / 100s$
		\closesection
		\subsection{Give an equation for the linear relation of the two clocks}
		\startsubsection
			$C_B (t) = 1.05 \cdot C_A (t)$
		\closesection
		\subsection{What is the clock skew of B to A}
		\startsection
			The skew is 5 seconds.
