	\startsection
		It can be difficult to gather information about needs and challenges or identify and locating problems within a city. Therefore it is proposed that only data should be used that is already available in the city, i.e. social media to detetct problems belonging to a certain domain. Additionally feedbacks from citizens can be used in a smart way to infer to certain challenges or needs. Another part of this research is the question on how citizens can be motivated to get involved in improving the city.
