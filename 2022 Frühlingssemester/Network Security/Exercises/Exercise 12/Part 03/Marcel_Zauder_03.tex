		\subsection{Malicious Software (DarkSide Ransomware)}
		\startsubsection
			Initially appearing in August 2020 the DarkSide ransomware was and still is a global ransomware campaign that targeted multiple industry sectors like financial services, legal services, manufacturing, professional services, retail, and technology. The most famous incident happened in May 2021 that forced the Colonial Pipeline Company to shut down the 5'500 mile long pipeline along the US east coast, one of the most important pipelines in the States as it carries 45 percent of the fuel in the United States. This ransomware prevented users tfrom accessing computer files, systems, or networks and therefore can immobilize or even shut down huge branches of an industry. In November 2021 the US Department of State put up a reward of 10'000'000 US-\$ for information leading to the  identification or location of the individuals. However, as of today no individual attacker was found.
