		\subsection{The encryption scheme in question 5 A isnâ€™t particularly secure. What are its weaknesses? How would you make it more secure?}
		\startsubsection
			The problem with this encryption scheme is that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the ASCII character and its cipher, meaning that the same cipher corresponse to the same character. Therefore an analysis of the ciphertext can be performed and a mapping of each cipher character to its original plain character can be made. \\
			A solution for this exploit would be to add some kind of randomness that can be reverted like using a seed or a predefined random function in order to mitigate such an analysis attack.
