		\subsection{A website is using one common salt for all user’s passwords, along with server-side hashing. Would using a different salt per user improve the security (and why)? Does a longer salt provide better security (and why)? Would you recommend (or not) to store the salts in an encrypted form (and why)? Assuming no salt was used, would client-side hashing (instead of server-side hashing) decrease the security (and why)?}
