		\subsection{The Wi-Fi NIC of two laptops happened to have the same MAC address. Assume that they have both entered the same Extended Service Set.}
		\startsubsection
			\subsubsection{Which of the IEEE 802.11 services are affected the most by this issue and why?}
			\startsubsection
				As long as both devices uses the same AP there wouldn't be a problem. However, if the laptops would change their BSS then association and reassociation problems can occur.
			\closesection
			\subsubsection{Would this conflict always be a problem (even if multiple Access Points may be involved)?}
			\startsubsection
				Yes, this problem would still arise even with the use of multiple APs, as only one MAC address should be associated with an AP.
