		Suppose Bob uses the RSA cryptosystem with a very large modulus $n$ for which the factorization cannot be found in a reasonable amount of time. Suppose Alice sends a message to Bob by representing each alphabetic character as an integer between 0 and 25 (A$\rightarrow$0,â€¦,Z$\rightarrow$25) and then encrypting each number separately using RSA with large $e$ and large $n$.
