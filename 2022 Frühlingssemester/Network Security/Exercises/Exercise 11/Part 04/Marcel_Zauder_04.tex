		\subsection{Give an example of a scenario in which PGP use would be appropriate and of a scenario in which you would rather use S/MIME. Justify your choices.}
		\startsubsection
			A scenario in which PGP would be the more appropriate choice would be if the message only contains plain texts. This is because PGP in this scenario is much less costly as compared to S/MIME. Additionally, PGP contains 4096 public keys, hence, being the standard for strong encryption. \\
			A scenario in which S/MIME would be much more of use is when the application needs to process multimedia files as this is not implemented in PGP. Furthermore, it is much more efficient than PGP as being more convenient than it due to the secure transformation of all the application.
